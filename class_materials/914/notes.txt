   * Introduction of project 1 [to be done individually]
       * Full Project Due Oct 1
           * Initial project plan due on Sept 19th
       * Initial project plan
            * Pick an ODE with one dimension to solve numerically
            * Pick an integral with one dimesion to solve numerically
            * The integral and ODE should have an exact solution
            * You should be able to write down at least two distinct limiting
              scenarios for each.
