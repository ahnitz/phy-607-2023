* Discuss results of cow trajectory integration
   * comparison of group's results
   * techniques
       * check for consistency with physical expectation
       * What other properties should this model have?
   * Numerical error
       * approximation error
           * Euler's method
           * Runge-kutta methods
       * finite precision error

   * Introduction of project 1 [to be done individually]
       * Initial project plan due on Sept 19th
            * Prepare a written summary of your plan which we will discuss 
              next Tuesday
       * Initial project plan
            * (a) Pick an ODE with one dimension to solve numerically
            * (b) Pick an integral with one dimesion to solve numerically
            * The integral and ODE should have an exact solution
            * You should write down at least two physical behaviors which
              can be verified for (a) and (b), e.g. conservation laws, limiting
              scenarios, etc.
       * Full Project Due Oct 1
