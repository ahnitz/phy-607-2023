   * plotting
   
* spherical cow 
   * produce standard output format
       * Assume vx = 1 m/2 and vy = 100 m/s, drag = 0, x0=0, y0=1000
       * for dt = .001
       * write a file that contains three columns, space separated
           * time position_x position_y
           * email file to ahnitz@syr.edu
   * plot x vs y position for the entire trejectory
       * plot the analytic prediction for the trajectory
       * do they agree?
   * Plot the kinetic, potential, and total energy.
       * Is the total energy conserved?
