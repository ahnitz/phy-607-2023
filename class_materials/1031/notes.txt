* in-class exercise [in groups of 3]
    * (1) develop a model for the data, each group member should try a 
          different model
    * (2) each person should use one of thier minimizers to fit the data
    * (3) test the goodness of fit by calculated the adjusted R^2
    * (4) compare the ability of each model in the group to fit to the
          data
