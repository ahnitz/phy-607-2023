* computational complexity
   * time / space
       * best / average / worst
   * what is the computational complexity of your sort algorithm?
   * sort algorithms
        * bubble sort
        * bogo sort
        * insertion sort
        * merge sort
        * ....
  * search algorithm
  * implement one other sorting algorithm for your vector class (keep the
        existing one as well)
        * plot the computational time / cost for n=1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5 for
          both algorithms on the same plot.
        * implement an O(nlogn) algorithm if you don't already have one
