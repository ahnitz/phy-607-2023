### Group Assignment: Computational Physics In-Class Activity

**Assignment Title:** N-Body Simulation of Particle Interactions in a Fluid to Model Drag

**Objective:** The aim of this project is to create a primitive n-body simulation to model the interactions between a projectile and particles in a fluid.


**Group Size:** 4-5 members per group

**Duration:** 1-1/2 class sessions

### Specific Task Description

1. **Joint Discussion and Pseudocode Planning (30 minutes):**
   - Understand the basic principles of n-body simulations and how they can be used to model fluid dynamics and drag forces.
   - Decide on the simulation parameters, including the number of fluid particles, mass of the projectile, and initial conditions.
   - Draft pseudocode for the simulation, focusing on the interaction between the projectile and fluid particles, how the code can be modularized, and what
   the function interfaces should be.

2. **Division of Work:**
   - **High-Level Analysis Script Writer (1 person):** 
     - Develops the main control script that initializes the system, runs the simulation loop, and collects data for analysis.
   - **Post-Processing/Plotting Script Writer (1 person):**
     - Creates scripts for visualizing the trajectory of the projectile and the fluid particles, plotting the velocity and drag force over time.
   - **Module Developer(s) (1-2 people):**
     - Writes the core module(s) for calculating forces between particles, updating positions and velocities, and handling boundary conditions.
   - **Unit Test Developer (1 person):**
     - Designs and implements unittests to verify the accuracy and stability of the force calculations and the integration scheme.
