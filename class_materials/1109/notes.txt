    * extend metropolis hasting to multiple dimensions
    * use your prewritten likelihood function and priors (of choice)
    * first get single walker to run for 100000 iterations
    * Plot the distribution of the walker positons after every 1000 iterations.
      * How does the distribution evolve?
      * Has the distribution converged?
    * write a 500 walker ensemble MCMC and run for 1000 iterations
