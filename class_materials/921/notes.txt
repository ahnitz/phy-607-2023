* correction on python ints (no max size in python3)
* python types continued
    * tuples, dictionaries, lists
* packages
* classes
    * inheritence
    * common methods
    * special methods
        * operators

    * high precision floating point object
          * add / subtract / multiply / divide
    * high precision vector inherited from list
          * (same methods as the floating point object)
