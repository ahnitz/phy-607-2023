* project1
    * instructions for runge-kutta / latex will be distributed today
* correction on python ints (no max size in python3)
* python types continued
    * tuples, dictionaries, lists
* packages
* classes
    * inheritence
    * common methods
    * special methods
        * operators
* [in class project] 
    * high precision floating point object
          * add / subtract / multiply / divide
          * built ontop of integers
          * use base 10
          * choose a specific number of significant digits
          * methods should accept either a LongFloat or float
          * define a print() in scientific notation 
    * high precision vector inherited from list
          * (same methods as the floating point object)
          * implement a sort method
[next class]
* timing of functions
* profiling
* computational complexity
